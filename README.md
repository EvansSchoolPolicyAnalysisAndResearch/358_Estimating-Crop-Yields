# 358_Estimating-Crop-Yields

This repository includes Stata do.files developed by the Evans School Policy Analysis & Research Group (EPAR) for the comparison of crop yield estimates following different construction decisions using data from the World Bank's Living Standards Measurement Study - Integrated Surveys on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA) surveys for Ethiopia and Tanzania. These files were developed as part of the EPAR Estimating Crop Yields project: https://evans.uw.edu/policy-impact/epar/research/estimating-crop-yields-implications-construction-decisions

Code is currently available for 5 survey instruments:
 * Ethiopia Socioeconomic Survey (ESS) Wave 3, 2015/16 (LSMS-ISA)
 * Ethiopia Socioeconomic Survey (ESS) Wave 2, 2013/14 (LSMS-ISA)
 * Tanzania National Panel Survey (TNPS) Wave 3, 2012/13 (LSMS-ISA)
 * Tanzania National Panel Survey (TNPS) Wave 2, 2010/11 (LSMS-ISA)
 * Tanzania National Panel Survey (TNPS) Wave 1, 2008/09 (LSMS-ISA)

The .do files include all of the code used to generate crop yield estimates from the raw survey data for a given survey wave. Click on the green "Clone or Download" button and choose "Download zip" to download a copy of the .do files, and follow the instructions at the top of the .do files to download the raw data, update the global filepaths, and run the code.
